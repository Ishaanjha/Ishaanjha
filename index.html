<h1 style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid white; background-color:white; color:seagreen;font-family: initial;"class="expexted">Travelling In The Next Century</h1><br><br>

<p class="p">Traveling will be extremely fast and easy in the next century. Supersonic (faster than the speed of sound) and double-decker airplanes will be in common use. It will be a matter of minutes to reach a place thousands of miles away. Railway trains may have speeds of hundreds of miles per hour. Flying cars may also be in use for travelling over shorter distances. Nuclear powered ships at sea will be moving at much faster speeds.

It may be possible in the next century to use atomic and solar energy in place of oil, coal, gas etc. on a very large scale. Electricity for the use of the public or for industrial use will be produced at all places with atomic energy at extremely low costs. Aeroplanes, cars, railway trains and ships will be run on atomic energy.

New medicines to cure all kinds of dangerous diseases in a quick way may be invented. Some diseases like blood pressure and cancer which are a present quite incurable will be easily curable. This will bring down the death rate. Human beings will be able to live much longer. Then new kinds of surgical operations may make it possible to correct all kinds of defects of the body.

Computers will be in more common use doing much of the thinking and planning that businessmen, architects, engineers, doctors and technicians have to do. As thinking machines, computers will be working in place of human brains in many ways.

Yet, all the above scientific progress is possible if all countries learn to live in peace. They should use science for peaceful purposes and for the progress of mankind.</p><br><br><audio id="bflat"> </audio>

<h1  style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid white; background-color:white; color:seagreen;font-family: initial;"class="expexted">Lifespan Of Humans In The next century</h1><br><br>
<p class="p">According to me 2nd things could be humanâ€™s life age, as of now any human being can live their life maximum by 130 years and on average 60 to 75 years. I wish scientist will find some solution to increase human life, it can be medicine or new routine which will help us live longer and longer but again I am not sure for this as this is very know natural fact, human body got old as its muscled get older and we do not have much control over it apart from diagnosing some diseases. As per our religion and science too, this human body is immortal and have to destroy in the end. This is how life teaches us lesson. But i am still very positive for this and hope our innovative human brain will find something which will help us live longer.</p><br><br>

      <h3>Roads in the next century</h3>
      <p>Technology didnt even spare our decent roads.Digital Roads will harness data, technology and connectivity to improve the way the Strategic Road Network (SRN) is designed, built, operated and used. This will enable safer journeys, faster delivery and an enhanced customer experience for all.Obviously,better than today's world.  </p>

      <h3>Phones in the next century</h3>
      <p>What! we won't have phones in the next century?According to a survey all the phones will be digital and will be far more better and portable than today's life.there's even the possibility that research into brain-computer interfaces will have reached a point in which we won't need a physical screen or microphone at all. </p>

      <h3>AI in the next century</h3>
      <p>AI is likely to replace routine jobs and repetitive tasks like picking and packaging goods, separating and segregating materials, responding to repetitive customer queries, etc. Even today some of these functions are still done by humans and AI will take over these tasks in the future. e.g Human resource managers,lawers,scientists. </p>
